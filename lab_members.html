      <h2> Current Lab Members </h2>
      <h3> Principal Investigator </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><h4><u>Hwan Kim Ph.D.</u></h4></li>
        <li>I came from S. Korea in 2002 (missed World Cup 2002!!) and am a microbiologist by training at the <a href="https://micro.uchicago.edu/program/faculty/dominique-missiakas" class="link" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a> and <a href="https://htrl.uchicago.edu/" class="link" target="_blank">Howard T. Ricketts Laboratory</a> (many thanks to Dr. Schneewind and Dr. Missiakas). I have studied various aspects of microbial pathogenesis, immune evasion mechanisms, host immunity, and host-pathogen-vector interactions in Chicago and now in Long Island. I hope that our research provides insights into the development of vaccines and therapeutics for microbial pathogens of public health importance. When I am not thinking about science, I enjoy eating delicious food my spouse made, reading fiction books, playing video games with our children, and cleaning the laboratory and house.</li>

      <h3> Graduate Students </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><h4><u>Luke Helminiak, B.S., Molecular Genetics and Microbiology</u></h4></li>
        <li>I received my B.S. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire. I then went and worked at the Next Generation Sequencing Laboratory at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN. For my dissertation, I study 
<em>Rickettsia</em> pathogenesis with a focus on hemolysin secretion and function. Following my graduation, I aim to work on infectious disease diagnostics and have the opportunity to have a direct role in helping patients. Thus, my goal is to work as a Laboratory Director in a clinical microbiology laboratory. I have a love of sports, and enjoy running, basketball, snowboarding, and archery. During my down time, I love listening to music and watching movies. </li>

       <h3> High school students </h3>
        <ul>
          <li><h4><u>Michelle Bok, Seoul International School</u></h4>
          <li>Michelle, a current junior at Seoul International School of South Korea, has held a long-standing passion for microbiology and microbial endocrinology. In 2021, she conducted independent research on the effect of extreme epinephrine release on the antimicrobial properties of the gut microbiome such as <em>L. plantarum</em> and <em>E. hallii</em>. Her long term goals are to break the paradigm that STEM is a field guarded by the elites and academia and instead that it trickles into the most mundane aspects of life, thus causing her to create the Global STEM Youth Journal — a student network consisting of members from 15 different nations, and one of her serious hobbies includes fencing. In this lab, she envisions exploring the correlation between different surface proteins of Rickettsia rickettsii that affect its virulence and different canine hosts as amplifying reservoirs for the bacteria as a remote intern.</li>
