      <h2> Colleagues </h2>
      <h3> Principal Investigator </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Hwan Kim Ph.D.</u></li>
        <li>I came from S. Korea in 2002 (missed World Cup 2002!!) and am a microbiologist by training at the <a href="https://micro.uchicago.edu/program/faculty/dominique-missiakas" class="link" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a> and <a href="https://htrl.uchicago.edu/" class="link" target="_blank">Howard T. Ricketts Laboratory</a> (many thanks to Dr. Schneewind and Dr. Missiakas). I have studied various aspects of microbial pathogenesis, immune evasion mechanisms, host immunity, and host-pathogen-vector interactions in Chicago and now in Long Island. I hope that our research provides insights into the development of vaccines and therapeutics for microbial pathogens of public health importance. When I am not thinking about science, I enjoy eating delicious food my spouse made, reading fiction books, playing video games with our children, and cleaning the laboratory and house.</li>

      <h3> Graduate Students </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Luke Helminiak, B.S., Molecular Genetics and Microbiology</u></li>
        <li>I received my B.S. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire. I then went and worked at the Next Generation Sequencing Laboratory at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN. For my dissertation, I study 
<em>Rickettsia</em> pathogenesis with a focus on hemolysin secretion and function. Following my graduation, I aim to work on infectious disease diagnostics and have the opportunity to have a direct role in helping patients. Thus, my goal is to work as a Laboratory Director in a clinical microbiology laboratory. I have a love of sports, and enjoy running, basketball, snowboarding, and archery. During my down time, I love listening to music and watching movies. </li>

        <li><u>Smruti Mishra, M.S., Molecular Genetics and Microbiology</u></li>
        <li>I am from Bhubaneshwar, India. I did my bachelor’s in Dental Surgery from Pravara Institute of Medical Sciences, India and my MS in Molecular Biosciences from Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. While at ACPHS I worked in Dr. Meenakshi Malik’s lab using an in vitro bioreactor infection model to study the evolution of daptomycin resistance in methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. For my PhD thesis I am working on understanding the contribution of polysaccharide synthesis operon on tick-borne rickettsiosis as well as its role in shaping host immunity. My research interests lie in the field of bacterial pathogenesis and infectious diseases, specifically in understanding the host-pathogen interactions and molecular mechanisms involved in the same. In my free time I love travelling and exploring new places with my husband and learning to cook new Indian dishes. I enjoy watching movies and dancing as well.</li>

      <h3> Undergraduate Students </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Linda Chen</u></li>
        <li>I am a current 4th year undergraduate student at Stony Brook University, receiving my bachelor’s degree in Biology. I was born in Manhattan, but my childhood did not remain in the city for the entirety. I have been raised in China, Maryland, and Queens before residing in Manhattan for a couple of years. My current research interests in this laboratory revolve around actin-based motility in Rickettsia amblyomattis and the diagnosis of Lyme disease through the release of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). My future goals involve aiming for a MD/PhD, combining the knowledge of medicine and infectious diseases to further the advancement of treatments and diagnosis of pathogenic microorganisms within humans. In my free time, I like to play video games, read fantasy novels and comics, and wasting more time than expected on Tiktok.</li>

        <li><u>Dennis Chu</u></li>
        <li>I am currently a sophomore at Stony Brook University studying Biochemistry. I hope to apply to medical school in the future and pursue a medical degree. Currently, I am working on building an in vitro tick feeding system within the lab in order to establish an easier and more efficient way to reproduce tick transmission cycles. Outside of school, I enjoy playing volleyball and travelling.</li>

      <h3> High school students </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Michelle Bok, Seoul International School</u></li>
        <li>Michelle, a current junior at Seoul International School of South Korea, has held a long-standing passion for microbiology and microbial endocrinology. In 2021, she conducted independent research on the effect of extreme epinephrine release on the antimicrobial properties of the gut microbiome such as <em>L. plantarum</em> and <em>E. hallii</em>. Her long term goals are to break the paradigm that STEM is a field guarded by the elites and academia and instead that it trickles into the most mundane aspects of life, thus causing her to create the Global STEM Youth Journal — a student network consisting of members from 15 different nations, and one of her serious hobbies includes fencing. In this lab, she envisions exploring the correlation between different surface proteins of Rickettsia rickettsii that affect its virulence and different canine hosts as amplifying reservoirs for the bacteria as a remote intern.</li>
