      <h3> Principal Investigator </h3>
      <div>
        <img src="media/hwan.jpeg" style="max-width: 220px;">
        <ul>
          <li><u>Hwan Kim Ph.D.</u></li>
          <li style="overflow: hidden;">I am a microbiologist by training at the University of Chicago and Howard T. Ricketts Laboratory (many thanks to Drs. Schneewind and Missiakas!). I enjoy working with pathogenic microbial organisms and understanding various aspects of pathogenesis, immune evasion mechanisms, host immunity, and host-pathogen-vector interactions. I hope that our research provides insights into the development of vaccines and therapeutics for microbial pathogens of public health importance. Outside the laboratory, I enjoy eating delicious Asian food, reading science fiction books, playing video games with my sons, and watching superhero movies with my wife.</li>

      <h3>Research Assistant Professor</h3>
      <div>

        <ul>
          <li><u>Ilia Rochlin Ph.D., Center for Infectious Diseases</u></li>
          <li style="overflow: hidden;">I was trained as an entomologist and epidemiologist at Cornell University and Touro College, respectively. I have worked at various capacities as a bacteriologist through laboratory director for state and local public health agencies investigating mosquito and tick-borne diseases within the eco-epidemiological framework as a complex system of interacting environmental, social, and biological factors. My work has encompassed a broad range of subjects from molecular biology and virology to entomology, ecology, and sociology. The common denominator among these diverse interests is the focus on public health driven by a quantitative approach and statistical modeling. My professional interests overlap with my long standing fascination with "old fashioned" natural history and pursuits in macrophotography.<br></br>E-mail: <a class="link">ilia.rochlin at stonybrook.edu</a></li>

      <h3>Postdoctoral Associate</h3>
      <div>
        <img src="media/cody.png" style="max-width: 220px;">
        <ul>
          <li><u>Cody Kempen, Ph.D., Co-mentored under Dr. Pawan Kumar</u></li>
          <li style="overflow: hidden;">During my doctoral studies, I was trained as a mucosal immunologist in the lab of Dr. Pawan Kumar, at Stony Brook University. My dissertation research focused on the role IL-17 signaling to Paneth cells plays in regenerating the intestinal epithelium post irradiation induced injury. Prior to my doctoral studies, I received my MS in Pharmaceutical Sciences at Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. There, I studied mechanisms of lung epithelial cell death in response to Ricin toxin under the guidance of Dr. Timothy LaRocca. Throughout my scientific career, I have been interested in host responses to injury, toxicity, and infection. My postdoctoral work aims to elucidate the importance of IL-17 and IL-22 signaling during Rickettsia infection. In the future, I hope to build a career teaching and inspiring the next generation of scientific minds. During my free time I enjoy traveling with my wife, watching sports (go NY Giants!), reading fantasy and science fiction novels, and watching movies.</li>

          <li style="overflow: hidden;">I received my B.S. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire. I then went and worked at the Next Generation Sequencing Laboratory at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN. For my dissertation, I study <em>Rickettsia</em> pathogenesis with a focus on hemolysin secretion and function. Following my graduation, I aim to work on infectious disease diagnostics and have the opportunity to have a direct role in helping patients. Thus, my goal is to work as a Laboratory Director in a clinical microbiology laboratory. I have a love of sports, and enjoy running, basketball, snowboarding, and archery. During my down time, I love listening to music and watching movies.<br></br>E-mail: <a class="link">luke.helminiak at stonybrook.edu</a></li>

          <li style="overflow: hidden;">I am from Bhubaneshwar, India. I did my bachelor’s in Dental Surgery from Pravara Institute of Medical Sciences, India and my MS in Molecular Biosciences from Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. While at ACPHS I worked in Dr. Meenakshi Malik’s lab using an in vitro bioreactor infection model to study the evolution of daptomycin resistance in methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. For my PhD thesis I am working on understanding the contribution of polysaccharide synthesis operon on tick-borne rickettsiosis as well as its role in shaping host immunity. My research interests lie in the field of bacterial pathogenesis and infectious diseases, specifically in understanding the host-pathogen interactions and molecular mechanisms involved in the same. In my free time I love travelling and exploring new places with my husband and learning to cook new Indian dishes. I enjoy watching movies and dancing as well.<br></br>E-mail: <a class="link">smruti.mishra at stonybrook.edu</a></li>

        <ul>
          <li><u>Hara Seo, B.S.</u></li>
          <li style="overflow: hidden;">I have an interesting academic background where I fell in love with Music in my youth but learned the beauty of Chemistry as an undergraduate student. Interestingly, this unusual learning experience helped me raise two little monsters and sourdough starters! Over time, I became a microbiologist by self-teaching about the mysteries of sourdough baking. I started my career as an administrative assistant to the director of Howard T. Ricketts Laboratory at Argonne National Laboratory. Since moving to Stony Brook, I am learning whole new knowledge about tick-borne <em>Rickettsia</em>. I am quite excited about this new journey! And, I enjoy baking, listening music, and spending time with one big and two little monsters.<br></br>E-mail: <a class="link">hara.seo at stonybrook.edu</a></li>

          <li><u>JoAnn Mugavero, B.S.</u></li>
          <li style="overflow: hidden;">I graduated from Stony Brook back in 1980 and immediately began working on Foot and Mouth Disease Virus at Plum Island, then at Brookhaven National Laboratory on DNA damage and repair. From there I spent 29 years at Stony Brook working on poliovirus and Dengue virus and currently I am in Hwan's lab where I intend to stay until I retire. I have always enjoyed  swimming, fishing, camping, boating, hiking and especially bird watching. For over 20 years I had a permanent campsite in Greenport where I would stay on weekends and vacations where I enjoyed all of these outdoor activities. Growing up I spent weekends in Vermont at my Aunt and Uncle's ski lodge where I enjoyed countless hours of skiing. When I relax indoors I enjoy cooking and reading, especially historical fiction. I also love opera and enjoy going to Broadway shows. For the time being though I am enjoying learning new things in the lab and spending time with my family is my number one pleasure.<br></br>E-mail: <a class="link">joann.mugavero at stonybrook.edu</a></li>

While there, I worked in Dr. Utpal Pal's laboratory studying <em>I. scapularis</em> (deer tick) developmental pathways. I am excited to keep working with ticks, and branching out with both experimental work as well as species of tick! I hope to pursue public outreach and teaching roles in the future. Other than biology, I have a huge interest in classics, especially the Latin language and Roman culture. In my spare time I am often in Pennsylvania visiting my family (including my 5 brothers!).<br></br>E-mail: <a class="link">molly.thompson at stonybrook.edu</a></li>
